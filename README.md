🚀 Excited to share my latest project on predicting 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀! 

🚀In this project, I worked with a challenging 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗻 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀 dataset, diving deep into the full machine learning pipeline. Here's a quick overview of the steps:

🎀𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Started with loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns.

📊𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Created engaging visualizations  to better understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

🔧𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠: Handled missing values effectively and scaled the data to ensure model performance.

📌𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐦𝐛𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚: Addressed class imbalance using advanced techniques to ensure fair model evaluation.

🎗𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for robust model validation.

💫𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 & 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Evaluated multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to find the best performer.

🎯𝐇𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐓𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: Fine-tuned Random Forest and XGBoost models to squeeze out the best possible performance .

💥𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐧 & 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:-
After a thorough comparison, I found that XGBoost emerged as the top performer with an impressive accuracy and ROC-AUC score, making it the best choice for this task.
Random Forest was a strong contender as well!

🔍𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬: This project was a comprehensive journey through the machine learning lifecycle, from data wrangling to model tuning. It was exciting to see how each step contributed to building a robust prediction model for loan status.

🎉I'm thrilled to continue exploring and learning more in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning! 🌟
